# Java OOP Fundamentals Project
This project showcases core object-oriented programming concepts in Java, including classes, constructors, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. It includes examples like Book and Student for encapsulation, Car with constructor overloading, and Shape with abstract classes and method overriding via Circle and Rectangle. These programs demonstrate how real-world entities can be modeled in code using OOP principles.
